# LightGBM
# LightGBM in Python: A Modern Guide with Visualization

## Overview
This project explores **LightGBM (Light Gradient Boosting Machine)**, one of the fastest and most efficient gradient boosting frameworks.  
It includes:
- An SEO-optimized article (1200+ words) with unique insights into LightGBM.  
- Python code snippets for model training.  
- Visualizations for feature importance, decision boundaries, and hyperparameter tuning.  
- References in **APA 7th edition** style.  

## Features
- Introduction to LightGBM and its advantages over XGBoost and CatBoost.  
- Real-world use cases in **finance, healthcare, and NLP**.  
- Hands-on **Python code examples** for:
  - Training a LightGBM model.  
  - Visualizing feature importance with `matplotlib` and `seaborn`.  
  - Hyperparameter tuning with **Optuna**.  
- Professional references for credibility and further reading.  

## Visualizations
The article demonstrates:  
- **Feature Importance Plot**  
- **Tree Visualization** using `dtreeviz`  
- **Hyperparameter Optimization Curves** with `Optuna`  

Example:
```python
import lightgbm as lgb
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Train model
model = lgb.LGBMClassifier()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Feature importance
lgb.plot_importance(model, max_num_features=10)
plt.show()
